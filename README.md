# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a passenger would survive the sinking of the Titanic based on various factors such as socio-economic status, age, gender, and more. Using machine learning techniques, we analyze the Titanic dataset to build a predictive model.

## Project Overview

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others. This project explores these factors and builds a predictive model to estimate a passenger's survival chances.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes features such as:

- **Pclass**: Passenger's socio-economic status (1st, 2nd, 3rd class)
- **Age**: Age of the passenger
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger
- **Fare**: The fare paid by the passenger
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
- **Parch**: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
